## REST API Design

Design a REST API based on a topic we choose in class. The topic is:


aimodels

 
Note that you are to design and document a potential REST API that is CRUDable based on this topic. NOT implement it. 

You can use any format/structure you like (feel free to be creative) and it can be handed in as a spreadsheet, txt, markdown, image, xml, diagram or whatever. 
I recommend that you do it differently from how we did it in class to enforce your understanding of the three conventions. 
Knowing them and using them is a core tenet of this course. 
 

The point of the exercise is that you understand the three conventions we have talked about: 

1. Using the right HTTP method for the action. 
2. The ordering of the HTTP methods. 
3. The standardization of the endpoints which should reflect the underlying collections in your system.
