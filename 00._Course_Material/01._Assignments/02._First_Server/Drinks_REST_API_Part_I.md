# Rest API - Part I

1. Design the Drinks API.

 

2. Create a new Express project from scratch. 



3. Start implementing the REST API that does CRUD over Drinks. 

For this week you only need to implement the GET requests. 

Make sure that you follow the REST conventions we talked about last week.

 
Validation is optional in this assignment. I will not have a fixed schema and thus allow users to define any type of content as long as they don’t overwrite the id. 


Don’t work with database or use a persistence layer. Do everything in memory with variables. 

The biggest challenge is to consider the appropriate data type for the resource.
