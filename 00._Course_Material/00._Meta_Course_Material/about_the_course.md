# About this Course: **Full Stack Node.js**

Reflect on the course's title.  Besides Node.js it is:

- UX is important. Always think before you code. We have a code first approach in class because we are constrained by time. This is not ideal.
- Understanding the relationship between backend and frontend is crucial.  


## Course Components

### Homework
- Weekly exercises that you must hand-in. Once the hand-in closes in Teams it won’t reopen. 

### Hand-in Procedure
- Git link to the relevant folder. 

### Mandatories
Prerequisite to go to the exam.

#### Mandatory I:
- The weekly homework has been handed-in or a 1 page report on the topic for each missed hand-in. 
- Contains write-ups about the topics we go through in class in depth. So better start taking notes and writing these things down weekly. I won’t give you the topics so part of the exercise is to research what to write about and collect the info. 


#### Mandatory II:
- Done with Svelte or other web frameworks. 
- Focuses on authentication and authorization in frontend and backend. 


### Exam Project
Solo or in groups. This is a large full-stack project that is different from the other projects. The requirements are basic so consider something you really want to build and put the hours into. A solid project is a good start for the exam.
- Must include the auth from mandatory II. 


## Additional Notes

### Communication
-  I really hope that people will be active on Teams. For all communication use the class channel in Teams for transparency. 

### Co-pilot Usage
Co-pilot is an excellent tool and I recommend that you use it in your future endeavours but for this course I highly recommend that you refrain from using it. Arguments:
  - Rather than focusing on its suggestion you should focus on understanding the syntax. 
  - During the exam you will be live coding and co-pilot is not an option.
